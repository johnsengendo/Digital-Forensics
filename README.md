# Digital-Forensics
DF project to train a Generative Adversarial Network. In this project, I built and trainned an adversarila network that took in a fashion MINT dataset.
The netwotk of two parts, the generator and discriminator. The genrator produced images that resembled the fashion data and these where to the discriminator to check if they are real or fake.
When the images are neglected by the discriminator, the generator learns to make better images that resemble the real images.
